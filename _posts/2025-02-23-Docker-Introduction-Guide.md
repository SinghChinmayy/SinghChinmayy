# DevOps with Docker

## TL;DR
This blog covers essential Docker concepts, including networks, volumes, and Docker Compose. Learn how to manage containers efficiently using practical examples and commands.

---

## Docker Networks
Docker networks allow containers to communicate with each other. The main types include:

1. **Bridge (Default)**: Provides internal networking for containers.
2. **Host**: Removes network isolation and uses the host's network directly.
3. **Macvlan**: Assigns a MAC address to each container, making them appear as physical devices on the network.

## Docker Compose File
Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications with a simple YAML configuration file. It helps in managing multiple services, setting up networks, mounting volumes, and defining restart policies.

### Structure of a Docker Compose File
A typical Docker Compose file consists of:

- **Version**: Specifies the Compose file format version.
- **Services**: Defines the containers that will be created.
- **Volumes**: Manages persistent storage.
- **Networks**: Configures container communication.
- **Environment Variables**: Passes configuration settings.
- **Restart Policy**: Defines how containers restart on failure.

### Example Docker Compose File
```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  kavita:
    image: jvmilazz0/kavita:latest
    volumes:
      - ./manga:/manga
      - ./data:/kavita/config
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Mount Storage in Docker Compose
To persist data across container restarts, mount directories as volumes:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./from/where:/to/where
```

## Docker Cheatsheet
| Command                  | Description                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `sudo docker ps -a`      | List all containers                     |
| `sudo docker start`      | Start a stopped container               |
| `docker images`          | List all images                         |
| `docker system prune -a --volumes` | Remove all unused containers, networks, images, and volumes |
| `sudo systemctl restart docker` | Restart Docker service           |

## Docker Volume Management
### Creating a Docker Volume
```sh
docker volume create \  
  --driver local \  
  --opt type=none \  
  --opt device=/path/to/sdc \  
  --opt o=bind \  
  myvolume
```

### Listing and Inspecting Volumes
```sh
docker volume ls
docker volume inspect myvolume
```

### Using a Volume in a Container
```sh
docker run -it --rm -v myvolume:/data alpine sh
```

## Using Docker Volumes in Docker Compose
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: myapp
    volumes:
      - myvolume:/data
volumes:
  myvolume:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      device: /path/to/sdc
      o: bind
```

## Exposing a Port in Docker
Example configuration:
```yaml
services:
  kavita:
    image: jvmilazz0/kavita:latest
    volumes:
      - ./manga:/manga
      - ./data:/kavita/config
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```

## Conclusion
This blog provides a comprehensive guide to using Docker for DevOps. Youâ€™ve learned about networking, volume management, and Compose files to efficiently manage your containers. Master these concepts, and you'll be on your way to becoming a Docker pro!
